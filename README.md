The winter break was a bit cold this year which scuttled my holiday skiing plans. The frigid temperatures felt like living in an icebox. So instead of skiing, I packaged up my family and transported them to [San Antonio Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio) to attend [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com) a very large gaming convention. We spent most of our time playing tabletop games, though there was a fair amount of video game action going on. I re-learned how to play [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and acquired a few decks inclduing pre-release cards that were special for the event.

This winter I worked a lot. And I slept a lot. I wish I could have slept more. When I graduate, I am going to dedicate an entire year to sleeping. Man, I love sleep. Work is fun, too.

I viewed some online youTube course lectures from MIT OCW locally in K'bunk:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-003sc-engineering-dynamics-fall-2011/
// ^ I got about 1/4 of the way into this one.

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/

// ^ I started this late November, and got through all (although could stand to
// re-view several lectures some of which went at least partially over my
// head).  There are some neat demo videos on virtual
// creatures, training a robot to bounce a ball, and having software
// discover and extract plot themes from Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'.

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-71-optics-spring-2009/

// ^ I got about 1/2 way through these.  I need to re-view some of
// these also.

I also shoveled snow, ate, slept, watched episodes of Fringe and
Falling Skies, played around with Python, and read some nonfiction
books on Brexit and writing clear English prose.
