The winter break was a bit cold this year which scuttled my holiday skiing plans. The frigid temperatures felt like living in an icebox. So instead of skiing, I packaged up my family and transported them to [San Antonio Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio) to attend [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com) a very large gaming convention. We spent most of our time playing tabletop games, though there was a fair amount of video game action going on. I re-learned how to play [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) and acquired a few decks including pre-release cards that were special for the event.

This winter I worked a lot. And I slept a lot. I wish I could have slept more. When I graduate, I am going to dedicate an entire year to sleeping. Man, I love sleep. Work is fun, too.

Sledding highlighted my winter break. My youngest daughter and I, during
the cold snap, just after a nice powdery snow fall decided that sledding
was a necessity. After testing the waters at Reiche playground and getting
board with the short runs, we head for a bigger hill, the Western Prom.
Not sure if you have been out there but the hill is so steep it forces
the walking paths to have several switchbacks. We assume the usual
positions, with my daughter in my lap and my legs out to the side
for steering. After a slow long run along the upper path my daughter
looks down the hill and affirms that we will be going down the
steep part next. As we turn down towards Valley Street our speed
picks up with vigor and power blinds the driver. We hit the
first path below us with a thud and the sled comes to an abrupt stop.
With a laugh we start up the hill again for a second run. This time
we make it past the first path and gain even more speed and crash hard
into the bank after the second path. My daughter went flying into the bank,
we broke the sled and I braced myself for the worst. I knew all was well when
my daughter springs up and said, "That was awesome. It's ok daddy we can
always get a new sled, but that was the best sled ride ever!"

During winter break this year I really did not do much. I went to all of my family's Christmas parties and went home for Christmas. I also tried to go running pretty much everyday even though it was ridiculously cold outside most days. Other than that I basically just played Fortnite and watched Netflix.

I work full time and go to school part time so winter break doesn't mean a whole lot to me. I still had to go to work everyday but at least I had a little extra free time to catch up on some quality family time. We attempted to bring our daughter out to play in the snow but that only lasted about 5 minutes because it was so cold. I ended up spending most of my winter break playing with Christmas toys and reading the same book over and over and over again, my daughter is two.

This winter break I spent my 28th birthday at Sugarloaf with my family.  We attempted to ski and snowboard, but damn it was cold.  We only lasted about 3-4 runs each day we were there.  Luckily the place we were staying at had a massive wood stove which got things cooking quickly.  Towards the end of break I went to Winter Park, CO for a week of fantastic skiing.  I would highly recommend Winter Park resort if you're a skiier.

This was a bit of a bittersweet winter break, because it never seems quite long enough does it?   I had to work for the majority of it however I did get a chance to have some fun.   I first took a quick trip down to Baltimore to visit with my brother for a bit.   We spent some time down in downtown Baltimore and Annapolis.   Had to indulge in some of the good food and drink they have to offer there.  
I then took a quick trip down into DC, where my girlfriend from Thailand flew in and met me.   We spent about 3 days doing the whole tourist circuit.   Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History,  N.M. Of American history ect.   I took her to see the Lincoln memorial and White House because it was something she always wanted to see.   

We then came back to Maine where she got a nice taste of this Artic weather.Despite the ridiculously cold weather we got a few trips into the White Mountains as well as Trips to Range Pond State Park and all around the Greater Portland Area. All in all 10/10 would take a winter break again if possible.

Over the winter break, I celebrated Christmas with my family. We always have a big Christmas party a few days before Christmas and every year we takes turns hosting it. This time it was cancelled because of a snowstorm on the day we were suppose to have it, and we decided to go out to eat a few days later instead. Other than that I played Warframe and relaxed.

I work full time so I did not have a "winter break" but i did end up getting the flu which turned into a sinus infection. Other than this almost month long ordeal I met an old friend that was visiting from Japan to see what the solar New Year was like in the states. I was at least able to entertain when I was feeling better from the flu, but before I developed the servere sinus infection!

This winter break I embarked on an epic journey to defeat the Dark Lord, He Who Must Not Be Named. There were many twists and turns along the way, giant snakes to be killed, Triwizard Tournaments to be won, wizarding exams to be passed. At one point we even realized that He Who Must Not Be Named could not be killed until we actually destroyed some of his favorite toys first. 7 of them, in fact, because 7 is a very powerfully magical number. I started a little boy, and in the end emerged as a man that grasped the true meaning of friendship and love.

Wait. I think that might actually be the Harry Potter series, and not my winter break. Actually, all I did was play Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone while enjoying not having the dark specter of impending assignment due dates hanging over my head.
